# Automation Company Specificity

- When creating tasks or instructions (e.g., to Claude/backend), explicitly include the current job's company name pulled from automation context (the scraped `company` value).
- Phrase tasks with the company title, not generic placeholders. Example: "Upload resume for Acme Corp" instead of "Upload resume for the company."
- If the company name is missing, state that clearly (e.g., "company unknown") rather than omitting it.
